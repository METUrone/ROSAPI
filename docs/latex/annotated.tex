\doxysection{Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{structbattery}{battery}} \\*Battery struct to receive the battery\textquotesingle{}s status. Be careful that voltage, current and remaining\textquotesingle{}s type is float. Type conversion may be a big problem sometimes. The success variable is not used for setting. When called a method to take data, it will be setted to false when there is a problem }{\pageref{structbattery}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classDrone}{Drone}} \\*\mbox{\hyperlink{classDrone}{Drone}} class to control the drone The class will be used always when controlling the drone with this API. It has basic functions, and is designed to send the commands, then give the control to you immediately. Meaning that you have full control of the drone }{\pageref{classDrone}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{structframe}{frame}} }{\pageref{structframe}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{structposition}{position}} \\*Position struct to send and receive positions to drone. Be careful that x,y and z\textquotesingle{}s type is float. Type conversion may be a big problem sometimes. The success variable is not used for setting. When called a method to take data, it will be setted to false when there is a problem }{\pageref{structposition}}{}
